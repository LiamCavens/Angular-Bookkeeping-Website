<h2>Transcription</h2>

<h3> use a human transcriber?</h3>

<p>While there are many electronic programmes now on offer which enable the transcription of the spoken word, they have yet
  to master the art of human interpretation. While a machine might be capable of interpreting the words of a single, non-accented
  speaker enunciating clearly into a good quality recording apparatus, with no background noise, no interruptions and no
  jargon, in reality, life situations don`t quite happen like that!</p>
<br>
<h3>Verbatim</h3>

<p>This type of transcription includes all the "uhms" "ers" and non vocabulary actions and gestures which make up, and are as
  much of a part of our language, as the spoken word. Good transcripts should be rich with these and as a transcriber, it
  takes a keen ear to identify and transcribe these accurately.</p>
<br>
